# Full-Featured-Blogging-WebApp-Using-Flask
This Project has been created by following the tutorial of Corey Schafer. The tutorial was very comprehensive and I got to learnt a lot.
Flask is a great tool. 
I used sqlite as the db engine. Apparently Heroku doesn't support sqlite with flask. 
Procfile and Requirements.txt are files for hosting it in Heroku. Don't bother with it.
